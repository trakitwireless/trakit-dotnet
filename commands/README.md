# Trak-iT API Commands Definition

The Trak-iT APIs use the same command definitions for all HTTPS, RESTful, and WebSocket commands.  For example, a "get icon" command in the RESTful service will return a JSON definition of the icon, whereas the same command to the Imaging service will return a PNG.
Other Trak-iT API libraries are available on GitHub.

## Getting started

Explain how to use your package, provide clear and concise getting started instructions, including any necessary steps.

### Prerequisites

The `trakit.objects` package is required as most `ResponseType` classes will contain an object from that definition.
We rely on the Newtonsoft.Json package for serialization between your application and the server.
